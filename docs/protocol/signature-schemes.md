# Signature Schemes

There are two address types which require corresponding signature schemes:

1. "RedeemAddress": Ethereum account address (for ERC20 redeem / backwards-compatibility); see `init/address.rs` in `chain-core`.
2. "Tree": threshold multisig addresses; records a root of a "Merklized Abstract Syntax Tree" where branches are "OR" operations and leafs are Blake3 hashes of aggregated X-only public keys:

- [MuSig: A New Multisignature Standard](https://blockstream.com/2019/02/18/musig-a-new-multisignature-standard/)
