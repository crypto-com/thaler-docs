# Thaler Testnet: Running Nodes using Azure 1-click Deployment

The Crypto.com Chain Testnet has been named as **‚ÄúThaler‚Äù**.

This tutorial will use our Azure 1-click Deployment image to start and create the latest Thaler Testnet validator or full node.

## Azure Account Creation

You will first need to create an [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account with a `Pay-As-You-Go` subscription. This will require providing your credit card information to `Microsoft Azure` and you may be subject to charges when you create a virtual machine.

Please read `Microsoft Azure` free trial introduction to see if you are eligible for the free-tier.

## Common Setup

### Step 1. Search for Crypto.com Chain on Marketplace

Sign in to your Microsoft Azure account and go to [Marketplace](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/MarketplaceOffersBlade/selectedMenuItemId/home). Search for "Crypto.com chain testnet node".

| Configuration           | Value                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Region_                | DCsv2-series VMs for Azure is currently available in three regions: _East US_, _Canada Central_ and _UK South_   |
| _Size_                  | Select either _DC1s_v2_, _DC2s_v2_ (Recommended) or _DC4s_v2_                                                    |
| _SSH public key source_ | Choose _"existing public key"_                                                                                   |
| _SSH public key_        | Copy and past your [SSH public key](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/mac-create-ssh-keys) |
| _Resource group_        | We suggest to create a new and dedicated one so that you can easily manage resources attached to the instance    |

#### Step 2-2. Disk

- Follow default setting

#### Step 2-3. Networking

![](./assets/azure_1click_networking.png)

- _Virtual network_, _Subnet_, _Public IP_ and _NIC_: "Create new" if you don't have any in that region

#### Step 2-4. Management

- Follow default setting
- _Boot diagnostics_: default is "On". Set to "Off" if it is not required.

#### Step 2-5. Advanced

- Follow default setting

#### Step 2-6. Tags

- Create Tag if needed

#### Step 2-7. Review + Create

- Click "create" to create your instance

### Step 3. Running the reconfiguration script

Once the deployment is completed, you can connect to your instance via SSH. Afterwards, go to the `chain` directory, and you will find all the essential binaries for setting up your node:

```bash
$ cd /chain/
$ ll
total 2344
drwxr-xr-x 10 root   root      4096 Aug 10 10:36 ./
drwxr-xr-x 27 root   root      4096 Aug 13 14:30 ../
drwxr-xr-x  2 crypto crypto    4096 Aug 10 10:35 .chain-abci/
drwxr-xr-x  4 crypto crypto    4096 Aug 10 10:36 .tendermint/
drwxr-xr-x  2 crypto crypto    4096 Aug 10 10:30 .tmkms/
drwxr-xr-x  2 crypto crypto    4096 Aug 10 10:33 .tx-query-enclave/
drwxr-xr-x  4 crypto crypto    4096 Aug 10 10:36 bin/
-rwxr-xr-x  1 crypto crypto 2334994 Aug 10 10:28 convert_to_pubkey*
drwx------  2 root   root     16384 Aug 10 10:20 lost+found/
-rwxr-xr-x  1 crypto crypto    7334 Aug 10 10:28 reconfig.sh*
drwxr-xr-x  4 root   root      4096 Aug 10 10:28 release_binary/
drwxr-xr-x  2 crypto crypto    4096 Aug 10 10:30 sockets/
```

Next, we use the reconfiguration script `reconfig.sh`, to clean up the old data(if any) and obtain a fresh validator key. Furthermore, you can choose the node type that you would like to run:

## A. Running a council node (validator)

#### Step 3-A. Running a council node

```bash
$ ./reconfig.sh
....
....
You want to run it as a validator or a fullnode? Enter V for validator or F for fullnode: V
```

To join the network as a validator, the validator public key is required.
The reconfiguration script `reconfig.sh` will print public key after generating tmkms signing key

```bash
Waiting for tmkms to run

Please keep consensus key and public key for node join if it is validator or find it in /chain/log/tmkms/tmkms.log

consensus key: 1624DE64203F50XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

converting consensus key to public key for node join
public key: P1DxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxQfk=
```

The script will also ask you to fill in the `moniker` value which is a human readable display name for tendermint p2p

```bash
Replace moniker in /chain/.tendermint/config/config.toml
Moniker is display name for tendermint p2p

moniker: YOUR_MONIKER_NAME
```

Tendermint and Chain-abci are now running at the background. You can check their logs by the command `journalctl`, for example:

```bash
journalctl -u tendermint.service -f
journalctl -u chain-abci.service -f
```

Once the tendermint syncs to the latest block, you can follow the instructions below to perform a `node-join` transaction and join the network.

::: details Joining the network as a Council node

In the following example, we will use the `client-cli`, a command-line tool to perform the address creation and join as a council node, which is located in the directory `release_binary`:

```bash
$ cd /chain/release_binary
```

Once we get there, we would need to set the required environment variables:

```bash
$ export CRYPTO_CHAIN_ID=testnet-thaler-crypto-com-chain-42
$ export CRYPTO_CLIENT_TENDERMINT=ws://13.90.34.32:26657/websocket
```

**Note**: In the above example, we will be connecting to a pulic full node `13.90.34.32`.

- Run the followings to create a new [HD-wallet](../wallets/client-cli.html#wallet-new-create-a-new-wallet) and [staking address](../wallets/client-cli.html#address-new-create-a-new-address):

    ```bash
      $ ./client-cli wallet new --name <WALLET_NAME> --type hd
      $ ./client-cli address new --name <WALLET_NAME> --type Staking
    ```

  Unless you have obtained the CRO testnet token before, simply send a message on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/crypto-com/community),
  stating who you are and your staking address (@devashishdxt or @lezzokafka would typically reply within a day).

- Afterwards, you can sync your wallet by:

  ```bash
  $ ./client-cli sync --name <WALLET_NAME>
  ```

  and check the state of your staking address:

  ```bash
  $ ./client-cli state  --address <STAKING_ADDRESS>
  ```

  or 

  ```bash
  $ ./client-cli state --name <WALLET_NAME> --address <STAKING_ADDRESS>
  ```
  If you are using `client-cli` v0.5.3

- Once your node is fully synced, we are now ready to join the network:

    ```bash
      $ ./client-cli transaction new --name <WALLET_NAME> --type node-join
    ```

    You will be required to insert the following:

    - the staking address that holds your bonded funds;
    - a moniker(name) for your validator node; and
    - a base64 encoded tendermint validator public key we obtained earlier. 

    Once the node-join transaction was successfully broadcasted, you should be able to see your Council node one the [testnet explorer](https://chain.crypto.com/explorer/council-nodes).

    To further check if the council node is signing blocks, kindly run this [script](https://github.com/crypto-com/chain-docs/tree/master/docs/getting-started/assets/signature_checking/check-validator-up.sh) with the flag `--pubkey` to specify the public key of your validator. For example:

    ```bash
      $ ./check-validator-up.sh --tendermint-url http://13.90.34.32:26657 --pubkey "<YOUR_VALIDATOR_PUBLICKEY>"
      The validator is in the council nodes set under the address <YOUR_VALIDATOR_ADDRESS>
      The validator is signing @ Block#<BLOCK_HEIGHT> üëç
    ```

    Alternatively, you can run it on this [browser based IDE](https://repl.it/@allthatjazzleo/cryptocomcheckNodeJoinStatus#main.go), by specifying your validator public key in the `"YOUR_PUBKEY"` field.

**Note**: For security purpose, It is strongly suggested that you should run the client-cli on a local machine in the actual production deployment.
  :::

## B. Running a full node

#### Step 3-B. Running a full node

```bash
$ ./reconfig.sh
....
....
You want to run it as a validator or a fullnode? Enter V for validator or F for fullnode: F
```

Can ignore public key information this part for full node setup

The script will also ask you to fill in the `moniker` value which is the display name for tendermint p2p

```bash
Replace moniker in /chain/.tendermint/config/config.toml
Moniker is display name for tendermint p2p

moniker: YOUR_MONIKER_NAME
```

The script will also ask to provide `SPID` and `IAS_API_KEY`

```
Replace spid and ias_api_key in /lib/systemd/system/tx-query-enclave.service

SPID: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
IAS_API_KEY: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Add public IP to external_address in tendermint config.toml for fullnode
```

::: details To create your own SPID and IAS_API_KEY

On the [Intel's developer portal](https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/EPID-attestation), you can sign up for an _Intel¬Æ Developer Zone_ account; under _Development Access_, you can obtain credentials for the non-production _DEV Intel¬Æ Software Guard Extensions Attestation Service_ and choose _"unlinkable quotes"_.

Once you obtained the credentials in the portal, you can check the "_Subscription details_" in your profile page, then set the following environment variables:

- `SPID`: Set it to the "Service Provider ID (SPID)" value from the portal;
- `IAS_API_KEY`: Set it to the primary or secondary API key from the portal.

:::

Tendermint, Chain-abci and Tx-query-enclave are running at the background. You can check their logs by the command `journalctl`, for example:

```bash
journalctl -u tendermint.service -f
journalctl -u chain-abci.service -f
journalctl -u tx-query-enclave.service -f
```

Once the tendermint syncs to the latest block, you can perform transactions as described in [client-cli](../wallets/client-cli.md).

#### Step 3-B-1 Allow port in azure

For remote access to the full node from cli or client-rpc, you need to open the port in [azure network security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/security-overview).

| Name             | Port  | Source         |
| ---------------- | ----- | -------------- |
| _Tendermint-p2p_ | 26656 | any            |
| _Tendermint-rpc_ | 26657 | YOUR_SOURCE_IP |
| _TQE_            | 3322  | YOUR_SOURCE_IP |
