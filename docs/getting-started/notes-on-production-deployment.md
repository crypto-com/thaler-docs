# Notes on Production Deployment

- See [Tendermint notes on running in production](https://tendermint.com/docs/tendermint-core/running-in-production.html#database)
- Validators shouldn’t be exposed directly to the internet
- RPC shouldn’t be exposed directly to the internet (as it currently doesn’t support rate-limiting, authentication…)
- Validator block signing should be via [kms](https://github.com/tendermint/kms#tendermint-kms-)
