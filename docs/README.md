The high-level design vision is documented in

1) [whitepaper](https://crypto.com/images/chain_whitepaper.pdf) and

2) [technical whitepaper](https://www.crypto.com/images/chain_technical_whitepaper.pdf).

For a bit clearer technical vision, see [design philosophy](https://github.com/crypto-com/chain/blob/master/PHILOSOPHY.md).

The documentation in this repository site is meant to provide specifications and implementation details that will be useful to third party developers or contributors to the main [repository](https://github.com/crypto-com/chain).
